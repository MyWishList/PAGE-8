    <p>Captain Underpants is an illustrated children's novel series by American author and illustrator Dav Pilkey. The series revolves around two fourth-graders, George Beard and Harold Hutchins, living in Piqua, Ohio, and Captain Underpants, an aptly named superhero from one of the boys' homemade comic books, who accidentally ("kinda on purpose") becomes real when George and Harold hypnotize their ill-tempered principal, Mr. Krupp. Soon after, Mr. Krupp gains superpowers by drinking alien juices in the third book.

Currently, the series includes 12 books, two activity books, 11 spin-offs, and won a Kids' Choice Award on April 4, 2006. As of 2014, the series has been translated into more than 20 languages,[1] with more than 80 million books sold worldwide,[1] including over 50 million in the United States.[2] DreamWorks Animation acquired the rights to the series to make an animated feature film adaptation, which was released on June 2, 2017, to positive reviews.

After the main series concluded with the twelfth novel, Captain Underpants and the Sensational Saga of Sir Stinks-A-Lot, in 2015, a spin-off series titled Dog Man was released the following year.[3] This spin-off series has nine books so far.<br><br>Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a series of fiction books written by the American author and cartoonist Jeff Kinney.[1][2] All the main books are the journals of the main character, Greg Heffley. Befitting a teen's diary, the books are filled with simple drawings of Greg's daily adventures.[3]

Since the release of the online version in May 2004, most of the books have garnered positive reviews and commercial success. As of 2020, more than 250 million copies have been sold globally.[4]

The first, second, fourth and ninth installments have been adapted into films by 20th Century Fox.[5]

The game Poptropica, itself also created by Kinney, has released two islands themed after Diary of a Wimpy Kid, called Wimpy Wonderland and Wimpy Boardwalk.

Diary of a Wimpy Kid officially began when Kinney brought up an idea about a middle-school weakling named Greg Heffley, who wrote about his personal life. In May 2004, FunBrain and Kinney released an online version of Diary of a Wimpy Kid. The website made daily entries until June 2005.[6] He worked on his book for almost eight years, before showing it to a publisher in New York.

In February 2006, during the New York Comic Con, Jeff signed a multi-book deal with publisher Harry N. Abrams, Inc., to turn Diary of a Wimpy Kid into a print series.[7]

The book became an instant hit, and the online version received about 20 million views as of 2009. Nonetheless, many online readers requested a printed version; Kinney agreed, and in April 2007, Diary of a Wimpy Kid was published.[6] To date, fourteen Wimpy Kid books have been released, plus one do-it-yourself book, two movie diaries, and a spin-off. In April 2009, TIME named Kinney one of The World's Most Influential People.[8]<br><br></p>
